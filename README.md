Spout
=====

Work on making a new version of a game called Spout, which I first encountered as a homebrew NDS game: https://pdroms.de/files/nintendods/spout-extended-v1-0-final

Live streaming some of the programming ony my youtube channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCC_zhLitvZ0EXdZ7rhAMTOw

Need to install sdl2 externally:
e.g. `pacman -S sdl2`

Also gperftools for the profiler, and pprof to view the profiles
