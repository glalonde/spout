Spout
=====

Work on making a new version of a game called Spout, which I first encountered as a homebrew NDS game: https://pdroms.de/files/nintendods/spout-extended-v1-0-final

Live streaming some of the programming ony my youtube channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCC_zhLitvZ0EXdZ7rhAMTOw

Need to install sdl2 externally:
e.g. `pacman -S sdl2`

Also gperftools for the profiler, and pprof to view the profiles

Here's the final version of the previous incarnation(click for video). I'm still getting backt to this point with the code in this repo, but it is on a far better foundation.
