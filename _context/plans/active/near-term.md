# Near-Term Features

Concrete next things to build — one step above backlog, not yet in active development.
Items are ordered roughly by dependency (text rendering unlocks most of the rest).

---

## 1. Text Rendering (prerequisite for HUD/UI) — IN PROGRESS (PR #55)

**Blocker for:** score display, game over screen, debug overlay, any menus.

Used `fontdue` (pure Rust font rasterizer) instead of `glyphon` — glyphon doesn't support wgpu 29 yet. Hand-rolled bitmap atlas approach is a better fit for Pixel Six anyway.

Tasks:
- [x] Embed Pixel Six font via `include_bytes!` (already in repo from legacy)
- [x] Implement `TextRenderer` struct (fontdue atlas + instanced glyph quads, WGSL shader)
- [x] FPS counter + score debug overlay (toggle with F3)
- [ ] In-game settings UI (see `autonomous-improvement.md` for design)

---

## 2. Ship Collision Detection — needs improvement

Bresenham triangle rasterization against CPU-side terrain grid shipped in PR #56,
but collision is not pixel-perfect enough in practice — the ship can visually
overlap terrain without dying, or die when it looks like it shouldn't.

Tasks:
- [ ] Audit the collision shape: verify the triangle vertices used match the
  rendered ship geometry exactly (check `ship.rs` fill vertices vs collision
  vertices in `collision.rs`)
- [ ] Consider testing every pixel of the ship outline rather than just triangle
  edges — rasterize the filled triangle and test all interior + border cells
- [ ] Test at different speeds: fast-moving ships may tunnel through 1-cell walls
  between frames; if so, sweep the ship path between frames

---

## 3. Score Display / HUD

**Depends on:** text rendering (#1).

Tasks:
- [ ] Score counter incremented by terrain destruction (particles hitting terrain)
- [x] **Fix: stop score incrementing once ship explodes** — gated on `!state.dead` in `main.rs` (PR #59 / 4cc9000)
- [ ] Render score + lives in a HUD using `TextRenderer`
- [ ] Fuel/energy gauge (visual bar or numeric)

---

## 4. Game Over Screen ✅

Done: title screen → playing → dead → game over → title flow implemented. "GAME OVER" text rendered, 'R' restarts. See PR #56.

---

## 5. Resolution / Aspect Ratio

Independent — no blockers. More urgent now that iOS is running on device.

Currently the game renders at a fixed internal resolution (240×135) upscaled to fill the window. On iPhone 15 Pro (2556×1179, ~19.5:9) the game viewport doesn't fill the screen correctly — letterboxed or wrong aspect.

Tasks:
- [x] Decide internal render resolution strategy → camera letterboxes game quad (261×160) into surface; bars on one axis only.
- [x] Full-screen Metal surface on iOS — see 8d above.
- [ ] Handle window resize gracefully (resize swapchain, update camera projection)
- [ ] Optional: expose resolution config in `game_config.toml`

---

## 6. Music Playlist Randomization ✅

Fixed: `rand` dep removed, `fastrand::Rng::new().shuffle()` used instead. Level terrain also randomized per-run. See `music.md` for details.

---

## 7. Music: Non-Blocking Track Render (WASM)

`render_track` runs synchronously inside `spawn_local` on WASM, blocking the main thread for ~2–4 s while a tracker file decodes. Visible as a freeze when a track loads.

Native is already correct (background thread via `std::thread::spawn`).

Tasks:
- [ ] Move `render_track` to a Web Worker on WASM (see `music.md` Phase 3 for options)
- [ ] Verify no main-thread freeze when starting / cycling tracks in the browser

---

## 8. iOS Platform Fixes

Observed on first run on iPhone 15 Pro (2026-05-02). The game launches and renders
but needs these fixes before it's properly playable on device.

### 8a. Horizontal boundary death ✅
Fixed in 4cc9000: max-health cells set in leftmost/rightmost terrain columns.
Secondary guard also kills ship on boundary exit (`c372de8`).

### 8b. Touch-to-restart ✅
Fixed in 4cc9000: tap anywhere on game over screen restarts; game over text
says "TAP TO RESTART" on iOS (cfg-gated).

### 8c. Music on by default on iOS ✅
Fixed in 4cc9000: `cfg(target_os = "ios")` override forces `music_starts_on = true`.

### 8d. Full-screen surface + letterboxing ✅
Root cause: missing `UILaunchScreen` key in `ios/Info.plist`. Without it, iOS
treats the app as a legacy app and runs it in 480×320-point compatibility mode
(1440×960 px at 3×), centered on the real screen with massive OS-level black
bars that don't pass touch events. Fixed by adding `<key>UILaunchScreen</key><dict/>`
to `ios/Info.plist`. Also added:
- `framework.rs` `init_gpu`: `window.outer_size()` on iOS (safe-area guard) + logging.
- `framework.rs` `resumed`: landscape lock, hide status bar + home indicator.

### 8e. In-game settings overlay (longer term)
See `autonomous-improvement.md` for full design. Lower priority.

## 9. macOS App Packaging — needs rebase + merge

Work is complete on the `macos-packaging` branch (diverged from master at
`a9fa746`, ~23 commits behind). Needs rebase onto master and a PR.

What's on that branch:
- `macos/Info.plist` — bundle metadata (com.glalonde.spout, Metal, macOS 13+)
- `scripts/package_macos.sh` — builds release binary, assembles .app, ad-hoc
  or Developer ID signs, optional --dmg flag
- `.github/workflows/release-macos.yml` — triggered on `v*` tags or manual
  dispatch; uploads .app + .dmg as release artifacts
- `_context/macos-signing.md` — signing/notarization docs (team HNRULUX5AH)

Steps:
- [ ] `git checkout macos-packaging && git rebase master`
- [ ] Resolve any conflicts (likely none — touches different files)
- [ ] Open PR and merge

## 10. App Icon

All three platforms need a proper icon. Currently only `assets/spout_preview.png`
exists (a gameplay screenshot, not a real icon).

Design brief: the icon should evoke the game — a ship firing particles into
terrain. Simple, bold, readable at small sizes. The particle glow/bloom
aesthetic should translate to the icon.

### macOS (.icns)
- Source: 1024×1024 PNG → `iconutil` generates the `.icns`
- Goes in `macos/` directory, referenced from `macos/Info.plist`
- `scripts/package_macos.sh` copies it into the `.app` bundle
- Sizes needed in the `.iconset`: 16, 32, 128, 256, 512 px (+ @2x variants)

### iOS (asset catalog or individual PNGs)
- Required sizes for iOS app icon: 60×60, 120×120, 180×180 px (iPhone)
  and 76×76, 152×152, 167×167 px (iPad)
- Plus 1024×1024 for App Store
- Goes in `ios/` as an `AppIcon.appiconset` (Xcode asset catalog) or listed
  in `Info.plist` under `CFBundleIcons`
- Add `ASSETCATALOG_COMPILER_APPICON_NAME = AppIcon` to Xcode build settings

### Favicon (web / WASM)
- 32×32 and 180×180 PNG (for apple-touch-icon) + `favicon.ico`
- Goes in `web/` or wherever the gh-pages build drops static files

### Suggested workflow
1. Create master 1024×1024 artwork (Figma, Pixelmator, or procgen from game)
2. Export PNGs → `scripts/generate_icons.sh` automates resizing with `sips`
3. `iconutil --convert icns` for macOS
4. Drop icon PNGs into iOS asset catalog

## Branch Audit Remainder

The `legacy_wgpu` branch has been audited (see `legacy-port-inventory.md`). These branches have not yet been reviewed:

- [ ] `glalonde-emitoverangle` — likely emit-over-angle feature for the particle emitter
- [ ] `glalonde-fpbresen` — likely Bresenham/fixed-point line drawing
- [ ] `glalonde-glslrand` — likely GLSL random number utilities

For each: fetch the branch, identify what it adds vs master, document in `legacy-port-inventory.md` or discard.
